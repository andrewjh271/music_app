# Music App

Created as part of the App Academy [curriculum](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/rails/music-app). 

This project was another dive into dealing with and keeping track of multiple tables and the associations between them, creating the appropriate routes, models, views, and controllers for each table.

User and session authorizations exist to allow users to login and remain logged in on their browser.

A gem `mailcatcher` is used in development to view the confirmation email that is sent upon a new account being created. The email contains an activation link that is required for the user to login.
